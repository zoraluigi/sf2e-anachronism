# Starfinder Anachronism: Official Starfinder Content Pack for Pathfinder Second Edition

The official Foundry module for adding Starfinder Second Edition content into your Pathfinder game!

Come discuss this module and Pathfinder 2nd edition on [our discord](https://discord.gg/pf2e).

Note that this repository is in a pre-release state, no data will be made available before the [Starfinder Player Core](https://paizo.com/products/btq09jzb) PDFs are able to be purchased from paizo.com

## Temporary Repository
This repository is a temporary one, made to house the module until we can reconfigure the system repository, from the end user perspective the switch will just be accepting a change of manifest URL during a future update. For contributors this will be changing what repository you submit PRs to.

## Redundant Content
This repository is meant to introduce Starfinder content, as such it does not include content already published for Pathfinder, even if that content was published in Starfinder Player Core. Examples include the *heal* or *avatar* spells, the Titan Wrestler skill feat, and more. The Starfinder 2e system will have its own copies of these items when it releases.

## Issues and Contributions
Please report any issues or data discrepancies on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TikaelSol/sf2e-anachronism/issues).


In order to make contributions to the module follow these steps. I assume some familiarity with git and node, if you are new to these things see the [PF2e system's contribution guide](https://github.com/foundryvtt/pf2e/wiki/Helping-with-Data-Entry) for a more in depth walkthrough:

1: Create a fork of this repo and clone it

2: Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) if they are not already

3: Navigate to your cloned repo and run `npm ci`

4: Run `npm run build` to build the module from the source

5: Make sure Foundry is closed, run `npm run link` then enter the path to your Foundry user data folder (It will look something like this on Windows `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\FoundryVTT\Data`). This will delete any existing sf2e folder you have, but will create a symlink between your cloned repo and the Foundry module

6: Make changes inside Foundry, then close Foundry

7: Run `npm run extractPacks` to extract all the changes you made

9: Commit and push, then create a PR
